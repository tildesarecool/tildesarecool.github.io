using video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfP7Y9Ja6Qc&index=3&list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB
(third video in a long playlist, 1st was "what is jekyll" and second was for mac os so i skipped it


first thing is the "ruby gems package manager"

I downloaded the "without devkit" edition, 2.5.1-1 x64
https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/

the video says to let it associate rb and rbw extensions so i'll let it

console window opens after installing it
video says to install all three in order
run 1 and uncheck "run msys2 64bit now" - okay that's proably obvious
i'm doing on this guest wifi on my toughbook so it ended up taking a while...
3:00 min in


run 2
updates all the ruby related packages
apparently this is installing linux/unix libraries and pacman/bash/mintty etc on to system

run 3
mingw etc development toolchain

open cmd prompt
--> confirm everything is working correctly
ruby -v confirms rub is installed and prints version
gem -v does same for gem installed/version printout

next:
gem install jekyll bundler 
[I changed to my local drive repo to run this command, not sure if that was necessary: no additional files in that folder so not necessary]

should say "2 gems installed" -- actually it came 26 gems installed. maybe i just misheard that.

jekyll -v should print out something like:
jekyll 3.6.0 [v3.8.5 in my case. it has been 18 months since the video]

tutorial part 4 for video series above
this is how to 

jekyll new [name of site]
e.g.
jekyll new my-new-blog

creates a bunch default files or "scaffolding"
for this part:
ended up creating repo on github first called "jekyll-windows-test"
then cloning that to local drive in my repo folder - this is an empty folder with just .git subfolder and a readme.md file
then at CMD shell one level up/in repo folder ran the command with "--force" to make it create the scaffholding in this existing repo folder
"jekyll new jekyll-windows-test --force"
the --force is to make it work into a non-empty folder
and it did work as far as i can tell




bundle exec jekyll serve
for first time running it
after that just 
"jekyll serve"
can see site at localhost:4000
this worked exactly as described
just a web server with a "ctrl+c to stop server" message

in directory structure
there is _posts folder
also
_site
which seems to be the "root" of the site - finished/final version

_config.yml file - the settigns for jekyll web site
atrributes for site
also "gemfile" - used to store depencies for site
the "minima" is a reference to default theme
can also specify plugins etc
